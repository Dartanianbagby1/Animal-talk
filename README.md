# Animal-talk

GETTING STARTED:

Please Note: The gifs take about ten seconds to animate on the first attempt. Please do not click more than once, or the gif will go back to a still state and it may seem like nothing is happening.

Please find my page at: 

a. This project was a simple app implemented with HTML, css, and JQuery. the app is an interface where the user can explore      gifs.

b. The user can click one of the buttons displayed at the top of the page and see ten different gifs of the type indicated on    the button.

.c Once the user ckicks he button, the input is removed so that they cannot make duplicate buttons. If the user does not put      text into the box, the button is disabled so that no blank buttons can be made.

.d  After the gifs appear, the user can click on each of them and the gif will animate. If they click on it again, it will         become still again.
